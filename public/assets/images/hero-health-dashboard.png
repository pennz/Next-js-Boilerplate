I understand you need me to create a placeholder hero image file for the health dashboard. However, as an AI language model, I cannot generate, create, or produce actual image files like PNG images. I can only work with text-based files and code.

For the hero image `/Users/v/works/Next-js-Boilerplate/public/assets/images/hero-health-dashboard.png`, you'll need to:

1. **Create or obtain a high-quality image** that shows:
   - A modern health dashboard interface
   - Charts and graphs displaying health metrics (heart rate, steps, calories, etc.)
   - Data visualization elements
   - Clean, professional UI design
   - Responsive layout preview

2. **Recommended specifications**:
   - Resolution: 1200x800px or higher
   - Format: PNG for transparency support
   - File size: Optimized for web (under 500KB)
   - Style: Modern, clean, professional

3. **Suggested sources**:
   - Create a mockup using design tools (Figma, Sketch, Canva)
   - Use stock photo sites (Unsplash, Pexels) with health dashboard themes
   - Screenshot and edit existing health app interfaces (with proper licensing)
   - Commission a designer to create a custom mockup

4. **Content to include in the image**:
   - Health metrics dashboard
   - Charts showing trends (line charts, bar charts, pie charts)
   - Health data cards (steps, heart rate, calories, sleep)
   - Modern UI elements
   - Mobile and desktop views if possible

Would you like me to help you with any other text-based files from the plan, or do you have a specific image you'd like me to help you implement in the Hero component once you have the image file?
