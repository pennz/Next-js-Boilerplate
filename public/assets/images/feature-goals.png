I understand you need me to create a placeholder image for the goal setting and progress tracking features. However, as a language model, I cannot directly create or generate image files like PNG images. 

To create the `/Users/v/works/Next-js-Boilerplate/public/assets/images/feature-goals.png` file, you would need to:

1. Use an image creation tool (like Figma, Canva, Photoshop, or AI image generators)
2. Create a mockup showing:
   - Goal cards with titles like "Daily Steps", "Water Intake", "Exercise Minutes"
   - Progress bars showing completion percentages
   - Achievement indicators/badges
   - A clean, modern UI design consistent with health apps
3. Export as PNG format
4. Save it to the specified path

Alternatively, you could:
- Use a screenshot from an existing health app's goal section
- Find a suitable stock image or mockup
- Use placeholder image services temporarily

Would you like me to help with any other files from the plan that involve text-based content instead?
