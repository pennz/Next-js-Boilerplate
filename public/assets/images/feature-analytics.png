I understand you need me to create a placeholder image for the analytics features of the health app. However, as an AI language model, I cannot directly create or generate image files like PNG images. 

To create the `/Users/v/works/Next-js-Boilerplate/public/assets/images/feature-analytics.png` file, you would need to:

1. **Use an image generation tool** like:
   - DALL-E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion for AI-generated images
   - Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD for design mockups
   - Canva or similar tools for quick mockups

2. **Create a mockup showing**:
   - Health analytics dashboard with charts and graphs
   - Data visualization elements like line charts showing health trends
   - Bar charts for different health metrics
   - Predictive analytics visualizations
   - Health score indicators
   - Time-series data for various health parameters

3. **Recommended specifications**:
   - Resolution: 800x600 or 1200x800 pixels
   - Format: PNG with transparency support
   - Style: Modern, clean interface matching the app's design
   - Colors: Health-focused color palette (blues, greens, whites)

Would you like me to help you with a detailed description of what the image should contain, or would you prefer to handle the image creation through other means and move on to the next file in the plan?
