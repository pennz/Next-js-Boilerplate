# Service Layer Business Logic Analysis

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of business logic patterns extracted from the health management system's service layer and API route handlers.

## Service Layer Business Rules

### HealthRecordService Business Logic

Based on analysis of `src/services/health/HealthRecordService.test.ts`, the service implements several critical business rules:

#### Value Validation Rules
- **Numeric Range Validation**: Health metrics must fall within physiologically reasonable ranges
- **Data Type Enforcement**: Strict typing ensures only valid data types are accepted
- **Required Field Validation**: Essential health data fields cannot be null or empty
- **Unit Consistency**: Measurements must use consistent units across the system

#### User Data Isolation
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Each user's health data is completely isolated
- **User ID Binding**: All health records are bound to authenticated user IDs
- **Access Control**: Users can only access their own health data
- **Data Segregation**: No cross-user data leakage in queries or responses

#### Temporal Constraints
- **Date Range Validation**: Health records must have valid date ranges
- **Historical Data Integrity**: Past records cannot have future timestamps
- **Sequence Validation**: Health measurements maintain chronological order
- **Time Zone Handling**: Consistent time zone management across all records

#### Error Handling Patterns
- **Graceful Degradation**: Service continues to function even when individual operations fail
- **Structured Error Messages**: Consistent error message format across all operations
- **Error Classification**: Errors are categorized by type (validation, business, system)
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Automatic retry logic for transient failures

## API Route Business Logic

### Authentication Patterns

From analysis of `src/app/[locale]/(auth)/api/health/` routes:

#### User Authentication
- **Clerk Integration**: All health endpoints require valid Clerk authentication
- **Token Validation**: JWT tokens are validated on every request
- **Session Management**: User sessions are managed through Clerk's session handling
- **Auto-logout**: Invalid or expired tokens trigger automatic logout

#### Authorization Logic
- **Role-based Access**: Different user roles may have different access levels
- **Resource Ownership**: Users can only access resources they own
- **Operation Permissions**: Specific operations may require additional permissions
- **Admin Override**: Administrative users may have broader access patterns

### Rate Limiting Logic

#### Request Throttling
- **Per-user Limits**: Individual users have request rate limits
- **Endpoint-specific Limits**: Different endpoints may have different rate limits
- **Burst Handling**: Short bursts of requests are handled gracefully
- **Penalty Systems**: Repeated violations may result in temporary bans

#### Performance Protection
- **Resource Throttling**: Heavy operations are throttled to protect system resources
- **Queue Management**: Requests are queued during high load periods
- **Circuit Breaker**: Automatic service protection during overload conditions
- **Load Balancing**: Traffic is distributed across available resources

### Feature Flag Implementation

#### Dynamic Feature Control
- **Runtime Configuration**: Features can be enabled/disabled without deployment
- **User-specific Flags**: Different users may have different feature sets
- **Gradual Rollout**: New features can be rolled out to subsets of users
- **Emergency Switches**: Critical features can be disabled immediately if needed

#### A/B Testing Support
