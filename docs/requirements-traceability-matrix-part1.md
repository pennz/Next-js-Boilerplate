## Traceability Matrix Overview

### Purpose
This requirements traceability matrix establishes bidirectional traceability between business requirements, user stories, and functional requirements for the Next.js health management application. It ensures complete coverage and enables effective change impact analysis.

### Scope
Part 1 focuses on mapping business requirements to functional requirements through user stories, providing the foundation for technical implementation traceability in subsequent parts.

### Matrix Structure
The complete traceability matrix consists of 6 interconnected parts:
- **Part 1**: Business Requirements to Functional Requirements Mapping (this document)
- **Part 2**: Database and API Implementation Mapping
- **Part 3**: UI Components and User Workflow Mapping
- **Part 4**: Non-Functional Requirements Implementation Mapping
- **Part 5**: Test Coverage and Validation Mapping
- **Part 6**: Change Impact and Compliance Mapping

### Navigation Guide
- Use cross-references to navigate between parts
- Each functional requirement (FR-XXX-XXX) is traceable across all parts
- Business requirements (BR-XXX) map to implementation details in Parts 2-6
