# Test Updates Summary

This document summarizes recent updates to the test suite and related documentation.

## New Test Files Added

- `PredictiveAnalytics.test.ts`: Implements comprehensive testing for predictive analytics features including:
  - Linear regression mathematical validation
  - Tolerance configuration system for health metrics with clinically significant tolerance values
  - Confidence interval generation and moving average calculations
  - Mathematical validation for statistical functions with precise calculations
  - Tolerance checking functions to validate if values are within acceptable ranges
  - Health metric tolerance definitions for 15 different health metrics based on clinical significance, measurement precision, and biological variability

- `HealthCalculationConsistency.test.ts`: Validates cross-module calculation consistency including:
  - ScoreHealthMetric vs normalizeHealthValue comparison tests to ensure identical results for percentage scoring across all health types
  - AggregateRadarData vs transformToRadarData comparison tests
  - Edge cases handling validation consistently across modules
  - Z-score calculations consistency validation
  - Tolerance-based validation with health metric-specific tolerance configurations

- `HealthDataFlow.test.ts`: Tests health data transformation pipelines with:
  - Performance measurement utilities to monitor test performance and memory usage
  - Enhanced health data generation utilities for more realistic health data simulation
  - Data transformation function validation including calculateTrend, formatHealthValue, getScoreColor, normalizeHealthValue, transformToPredictiveData, transformToRadarData, and transformToSummaryMetrics
  - Realistic health data generation based on typical patterns with weekly patterns for steps, gradual weight loss with noise, and random variations for sleep and heart rate
  - Comprehensive health record generation with various health metrics (weight, steps, sleep, heart rate)
  - Health goal generation with different target dates and statuses
  - Edge case data generation for boundary testing

## Enhanced Test Coverage
