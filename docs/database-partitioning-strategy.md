# Database Partitioning Strategy for Behavioral Events

As the behavioral_event table grows, partitioning will become essential for maintaining optimal performance. This document outlines a recommended partitioning strategy for future scaling.

## Overview

The behavioral_event table stores user interaction data, which tends to grow rapidly over time. Without proper partitioning, queries on this table will become increasingly slow as the dataset expands.

## Recommended Partitioning Approach

### Time-Based Partitioning (Primary Recommendation)

Partition the behavioral_event table by time periods (monthly or yearly):

- **Structure**: `behavioral_event_YYYY_MM` for monthly partitions or `behavioral_event_YYYY` for yearly partitions
- **Benefits**: 
  - Efficient time-range queries (most common pattern for behavioral analytics)
  - Easy data retention policies (drop old partitions)
  - Balanced partition sizes
- **Implementation**: Use PostgreSQL's native partitioning features

### Hybrid Partitioning (Alternative)

Combine time-based partitioning with another dimension for specialized use cases:

- **Structure**: `behavioral_event_YYYY_MM_user_range` 
- **Use Case**: When user-specific analytics are common
- **Complexity**: Higher management overhead

## Implementation Steps

1. **Design Phase**:
   - Determine partition key (created_at recommended)
   - Decide on partition size (monthly/yearly)
   - Plan partition naming convention

2. **Migration Process**:
   - Create partitioned table with same schema
   - Migrate existing data to appropriate partitions
   - Validate data integrity
   - Update application code to work with partitioned table
   - Switch to partitioned table in production

3. **Ongoing Management**:
   - Automate creation of new partitions
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Monitor partition sizes and performance

## Considerations and Limitations

### Constraints
- Foreign key constraints to partitioned tables have limitations
- Unique constraints must include the partition key
- Some operations may need to be performed on each partition individually

### Performance
- Monitor partition sizes to ensure balanced distribution
- Consider the impact on INSERT performance (slightly slower due to partition routing)
- Queries that don't include the partition key will scan all partitions

### Tools
- PostgreSQL's built-in partitioning features (PostgreSQL 10+)
- pg_partman extension for automated partition management
- Custom scripts for specialized partitioning needs

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Regularly monitor partition sizes and performance metrics
- Implement automated alerts for partition growth
- Plan for capacity and create new partitions in advance
- Test partition pruning effectiveness with EXPLAIN ANALYZE

This strategy should be implemented when the behavioral_event table reaches a size where query performance begins to degrade, typically when the table exceeds several million rows.
